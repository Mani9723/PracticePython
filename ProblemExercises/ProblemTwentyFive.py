"""
Guessing game two

This time, weâ€™re going to do exactly the opposite. 
You, the user, will have in your head a number between 0 and 100. 
The program will guess a number, and you, the user, 
will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.

At the end of this exchange, your program should 
print out how many guesses it took to get your number.
