"""  
For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, 
and be able to find that information based on their name. 
Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. 
When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, 
and return the birthday of that person back to them. 
The interaction should look something like this:

>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
Albert Einstein
Benjamin Franklin
Ada Lovelace
>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
Benjamin Franklin
>>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.
