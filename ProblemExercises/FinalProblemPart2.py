"""
In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names and birthdays to disk.
In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, and
count how many scientists have a birthday in each month.

Your program should output something like:

{
	"May": 3,
	"November": 2,
	"December": 1
}
